# The Project
This is my individual project for the first half of the Infinity Works Academy.

## Overview
To create a working Connect Four game that can be played in a browser. The intention is that the game can be played over the Internet and players scores are recorded in a table for all to see.

## Technology
This project will be developed in JavaScript with HTML and CSS being implemented for the front end.
